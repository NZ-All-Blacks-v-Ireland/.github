Ireland had never beaten New Zealand until 2016 but theyâ€™ve made up for it since, winning four of their subsequent encounters with the All Blacks. Unfortunately for Andy Farrellâ€™s side, however, they lost the biggest clash of all, last yearâ€™s World Cup quarter-final, and theyâ€™ll be desperate to make amends this weekend. After a disappointing Rugby Championship, the All Blacks narrowly pipped England at Twickenham last weekend, and â€“ with Farrell selecting a near-full strength side â€“ this promises to be one of the hardest fought matches of the Autumn Nations Series.

In other words, youâ€™ll want to know how to watch an Ireland v New Zealand live stream wherever you are in the world today. Find out more about the squads in our guides to the Ireland and New Zealand teams, and find out how to watch this weekendâ€™s other matches in our guide to Autumn Internationals live streams.
